# VirtualLib
-  A virtual library where I keep track of all of my books and information, including title, author, genre, rating, language
- Components include: book cover, author, title, language, genre, rating, favorite
Possible multi-pages: Home, Wishlist, Favorite

Progress tracker:
11/17/25: finished setting up frontend, using Vite + React and JavaScript. I decided to not use tailwindCSS.
Next step: set up backend using Express, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, and Python as the coding language.
